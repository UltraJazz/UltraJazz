<p>Minecraft is back as one of the most popular games ever after the
     collapse of fortnite, which was fated to die anyway. YouTuber Felix
      Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, was able to revive not only
      his channel but an entire video game by uploading a simple Let’s
       Play: “Minecraft Part 1.” This also revived Minecraft, which had
       stayed ignored for a few years. Now minecraft is back, we are able
       to look back at the history and development of minecraft
