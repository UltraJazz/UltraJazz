         Beta was the sixth and the final development phase that succeeded
         Alpha and preceded the full release of Java Edition, and was the
         fifth and final Minecraft development stage to have some of its
         versions released to the public. It was announced on Notch's blog
         on December 11, 2010 and released nine days later, on December
         20, 2010. As well as some minor updates, the transition from
         Alpha saw a 50% price increase (therefore making the cost 25%
         off the full price), a change in the disclaimer (Notch removed
         the line that said "all future updates will be provided free
         of charge", though the statement still applies to users
         who bought Minecraft before Beta was released. Both Alpha and
         Beta buyers got the full game free of charge) and minor updates
         to the main website.
